# Vercel Deployment Guide for Boardroom

## Automatic Deployment Setup

### Step 1: Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in/up
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import from GitHub: `Qualiasolutions/theboardroom`

### Step 2: Configure Project Settings
**IMPORTANT**: Vercel should auto-detect these settings, but verify:

- **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
- **Root Directory**: `.` (project root - DO NOT change)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (auto-detected)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` (auto-detected)

### Step 3: Environment Variables
**None required** - this is a demo app with mock data only.

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
3. Your app will be live at `https://theboardroom-[random].vercel.app`

## Auto-Deployment
✅ **Automatic deployments are now active!**
- Every push to `main` branch triggers a new deployment
- Pull requests get preview deployments
- Build status will show in GitHub commits

## Access the Live Demo
- Open your deployed URL
- Use invite code: `DEMO`
- Explore the boardroom interface

## Build Verification
The app has been tested and builds successfully:
- ✅ Next.js 15.4.6 compilation
- ✅ TypeScript validation
- ✅ Static page generation
- ✅ Bundle optimization with lucide-react package imports
- ✅ Zero border radius enforced globally
- ✅ Dark mode default theme

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
3. Ensure Node.js version compatibility (18+)

### If routing doesn't work:
- ✅ vercel.json is correctly configured (no unnecessary rewrites)
- ✅ Next.js App Router handles all routing automatically

### If invite code doesn't work:
- The demo authentication is client-side only
- Code: `DEMO` (case sensitive)
- Should redirect to `/dashboard` after entry

## Performance Optimizations Included
- ✅ TurboPack for development
- ✅ Optimized package imports for lucide-react
- ✅ Static generation where possible
- ✅ Bundle size optimization
- ✅ Image optimization configured

## Post-Deployment
Your boardroom demo is now live with:
- Invitation-only access (code: DEMO)
- Corporate black/gold/white design
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Mock founder community features
- Auto-deployment on every commit
